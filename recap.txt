Day 1 - Spring Core
	
	What is/Why Spring framework? Remember the standard built in factory house :D
		- standard for web applications
		- wide variety of tools
		- lightweight
		- easier and faster for the developers
		- big community
	
	Spring Inversion of Control? = Dependency Injection

	Spring core container modules:
	
		beans and core = offers a way to manipulate any kind of bean 
		context = application context <- we can find all the beans/properties inside it, it manages the lifecycle of a bean
		expression language = ways of call a method, getters/setters..
		
	Data container
		JDBC - support for JDBC opperations
		ORM - to map java objects to database entities
		Transactions - manage all the transactions in the app
	Web container
	Test container
	
	Spring 
	
	(metadata + POJO) inside Spring Container = ready to use app
	
	Types of configuration metadata:
	 annotations
	 xml
	 java code
	 
	How to create and find a bean
	@Configuration + @Bean (a method that returns a new MyObject)
	@Configuration + @ComponentScan({"com.sda.spring.core.config.scan"}) + @Component on our POJO
	
	inject beans in other beans:
		@Autowired
		types of @Autowired:
			- constructor (recommended by spring)
			- field
			- setter
	
	scope:
		@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_SINGLETON) - default used by spring
		@Scope(ConfigurableBeanFactory.SCOPE_PROTOTYPE)
	
	qualifier:
		@Qualifier - If we have an interface with 2 implementations we can tell Spring what implementation we want to use

Day 2 - Spring Boot and Spring Data

	Why Spring Boot?
		- stand-alone Spring Applications
		- takes care of a lot of configurations
		- starter dependencies
		- embedded server = tomcat
		- jar = Java Archive
			-contains compiled Java source code, manifest file, configuration data, data files, images, audio
			-Allows JRE to deploy an entire application including classes and the associated resources
		- war = Web Application Resource or Web Application Archive
			- contains servlet, JSP, XML, HTML, CSS and JavaScript files
			- Allows testing and deploying a web application
		- With Spring Boot there is no need to deploy the war as the server is included and configured
		
	Spring CommandLineRunner
		- a simple Spring Boot interface with a run method
		- use it when you want to execute some piece of code exactly before the application startup completes
		- Spring Boot will automatically call the run method of all beans implementing this interface after the application context has been loaded
		- we can have only one (use spring.main.web-application-type=NONE if not a web application) or multiple (use @Order annotation)
		- generally used for etl applications (Extract, Transform, Load)
		- general procedure of copying data from one or more sources into a destination system which represents the data differently from the source(s) or in a different context than the source(s)

	Spring Data
		ORM = Object-Relational-Mapping, concept, technique,  the approach of mapping objects to relational tables
			JPA = the EE standard specification for ORM in Java EE.
			Hibernate = ORM implementation, an implementation of the JPA spec, which itself is part of the Java EE spec
			Advantages: 
				- Letâ€™s business code access objects rather than DB tables.
				- Hides details of SQL queries from OO logic.
				- Based on JDBC 'under the hood.'
				- No need to deal with the database implementation (abstract away some of the complexity of interfacing with a database)
				- Entities based on business concepts rather than database structure.
				- generate queries using java
				- support for transactions, connection pooling etc..
		@Entity
			The tables will be created after our domain classes. 
		@Table (to overwrite the table name that this entity will map)
		@OneToOne, @OneToMany, @ManyToOne, @ManyToMany
			@JoinColumn
		@Repository, @CrudRepository, @PagingAndSortingRepository, @JpaRepository
		provides basic CRUD, Paging and Sorting queries 
			and also lets us add our own custom queries inside repositories:
				- using @Query annotations (native vs jpql)
				- using dynamic query derivation from repository method names (findAllByNameAndSurname..etc)
